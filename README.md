# WebDevBootcampExercises

Short exercises from the [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele.  
These are pretty short and simple exercises, so I didn't think they deserved one repo for each, so I put them all in here.

All mini projects can be seen from the repo's [website](https://joaquincasal.github.io/WebDevBootcampExercises/) (published using [Gitgub Pages](https://pages.github.com/))
